# Instruction
Your task is to identify whether a given dialogue between a user and a system can contain any contextual information about what the user is doing in [TASK_NAME].
Think Step by Step.

{
    "context": {
        "context_type": one of ["undetermined", "current", "has_done", "not_yet"],
        "step_index": an integer representing the step index (use -1 if "undetermined")
    }
}

Guidelines:
- "context_type" definitions:
    - "undetermined": Not enough information to decide what the user is doing.
    - "current": The user is currently performing this step.
    - "has_done": The user has already completed this step before, but no the current or previous step. If it's an action immediately before, use "current" instead.
    - "not_yet": The user has not done this step yet, but it is expected or planned.
- Infer "step_index" that is relevant to the context type from the dialogue (e.g., 4).
- Focus on the user's utterance instead of what Assistant says since Assistant may be misunderstanding.
For example, if the last utterance is from Assistant, it is likely "undetermined" unless the user mentioned their step in the previous utterances.
